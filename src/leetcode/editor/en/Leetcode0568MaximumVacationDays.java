//
//LeetCode wants to give one of its best employees the option to travel among size
//cities to collect algorithm problems. But all work and no play makes Jack a dull
// boy, you could take vacations in some particular cities and weeks. Your job is 
//to schedule the traveling to maximize the number of vacation days you could take
//, but there are certain rules and restrictions you need to follow.
// 
//
// Rules and restrictions: 
// 
// You can only travel among size cities, represented by indexes from 0 to size-1. Ini
//tially, you are in the city indexed 0 on Monday. 
// The cities are connected by flights. The flights are represented as a size*size mat
//rix (not necessary symmetrical), called flights representing the airline status 
//from the city i to the city j. If there is no flight from the city i to the city
// j, flights[i][j] = 0; Otherwise, flights[i][j] = 1. Also, flights[i][i] = 0 for
// all i. 
// You totally have K weeks (each week has 7 days) to travel. You can only take 
//flights at most once per day and can only take flights on each week's Monday mor
//ning. Since flight time is so short, we don't consider the impact of flight time
//. 
// For each city, you can only have restricted vacation days in different weeks,
// given an size*K matrix called days representing this relationship. For the value o
//f days[i][j], it represents the maximum days you could take vacation in the city
// i in the week j. 
// 
// 
//
// You're given the flights matrix and days matrix, and you need to output the m
//aximum vacation days you could take during K weeks. 
//
// Example 1: 
// 
//Input:flights = [[0,1,1],[1,0,1],[1,1,0]], days = [[1,3,1],[6,0,3],[3,3,3]]
//Output: 12
//Explanation: Ans = 6 + 3 + 3 = 12. 
//One of the best strategies is:
//1st week : fly from city 0 to city 1 on Monday, and play 6 days and work 1 day
//. (Although you start at city 0, we could also fly to and start at other cities 
//since it is Monday.) 
//2nd week : fly from city 1 to city 2 on Monday, and play 3 days and work 4 day
//s.
//3rd week : stay at city 2, and play 3 days and work 4 days.
// 
// 
//
// Example 2: 
// 
//Input:flights = [[0,0,0],[0,0,0],[0,0,0]], days = [[1,1,1],[7,7,7],[7,7,7]]
//Output: 3
//Explanation: Ans = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3. 
//Since there is no flights enable you to move to another city, you have to stay
// at city 0 for the whole 3 weeks. For each week, you only have one day to play a
//nd six days to work. So the maximum number of vacation days is 3.
// 
// 
//
// Example 3: 
// 
//Input:flights = [[0,1,1],[1,0,1],[1,1,0]], days = [[7,0,0],[0,7,0],[0,0,7]]
//Output: 21
//Explanation: Ans = 7 + 7 + 7 = 21 
//One of the best strategies is:
//1st week : stay at city 0, and play 7 days. 
//2nd week : fly from city 0 to city 1 on Monday, and play 7 days.
//3rd week : fly from city 1 to city 2 on Monday, and play 7 days.
// 
// 
//
//
// Note: 
// 
// size and K are positive integers, which are in the range of [1, 100].
// In the matrix flights, all the values are integers in the range of [0, 1]. 
// In the matrix days, all the values are integers in the range [0, 7]. 
// You could stay at a city beyond the number of vacation days, but you should weight
//ork on the extra days, which won't be counted as vacation days. 
// If you fly from the city A to the city B and take the vacation on that day, t
//he deduction towards vacation days will count towards the vacation days of city 
//B in that week. 
// We don't consider the impact of flight hours towards the calculation of vacat
//ion days.
