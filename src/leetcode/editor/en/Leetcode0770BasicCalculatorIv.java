//Given an expression such as expression = "e + 8 - a + 5" and an evaluation map
// such as {"e": 1} (given in terms of evalvars = ["e"] and evalints = [1]), retur
//n a list of tokens representing the simplified expression, such as ["-1*a","14"]
// 
//
// 
// An expression alternates chunks and symbols, with a space separating each chu
//nk and symbol. 
// A chunk is either an expression in parentheses, a variable, or a non-negative
// integer. 
// A variable is a string of lowercase letters (not including digits.) Note that
// variables can be multiple letters, and note that variables never have a leading
// coefficient or unary operator like "2x" or "-x". 
// 
//
// Expressions are evaluated in the usual order: brackets first, then multiplica
//tion, then addition and subtraction. For example, expression = "1 + 2 * 3" has a
//n answer of ["7"]. 
//
// The format of the output is as follows: 
//
// 
// For each term of free variables with non-zero coefficient, we write the free 
//variables within a term in sorted order lexicographically. For example, we would
// never write a term like "b*a*c", only "a*b*c". 
// Terms have degree equal to the number of free variables being multiplied, cou
//nting multiplicity. (For example, "a*a*b*c" has degree 4.) We write the largest 
//degree terms of our answer first, breaking ties by lexicographic order ignoring 
//the leading coefficient of the term. 
// The leading coefficient of the term is placed directly to the left with an as
//terisk separating it from the variables (if they exist.) A leading coefficient o
//f 1 is still printed. 
// An example of a well formatted answer is ["-2*a*a*a", "3*a*a*b", "3*b*b", "4*
//a", "5*c", "-6"] 
// Terms (including constant terms) with coefficient 0 are not included. For exa
//mple, an expression of "0" has an output of []. 
// 
//
// Examples: 
//
// 
//Input: expression = "e + 8 - a + 5", evalvars = ["e"], evalints = [1]
//Output: ["-1*a","14"]
//
//Input: expression = "e - 8 + temperature - pressure",
//evalvars = ["e", "temperature"], evalints = [1, 12]
//Output: ["-1*pressure","5"]
//
//Input: expression = "(e + 8) * (e - 8)", evalvars = [], evalints = []
//Output: ["1*e*e","-64"]
//
//Input: expression = "7 - 7", evalvars = [], evalints = []
//Output: []
//
//Input: expression = "a * b * c + b * a * c * 4", evalvars = [], evalints = []
//Output: ["5*a*b*c"]
//
//Input: expression = "((a - b) * (b - c) + (c - a)) * ((a - b) + (b - c) * (c -
// a))",
//evalvars = [], evalints = []
//Output: ["-1*a*a*b*b","2*a*a*b*c","-1*a*a*c*c","1*a*b*b*b","-1*a*b*b*c","-1*a*
//b*c*c","1*a*c*c*c","-1*b*b*b*c","2*b*b*c*c","-1*b*c*c*c","2*a*a*b","-2*a*a*c","-
//2*a*b*b","2*a*c*c","1*b*b*b","-1*b*b*c","1*b*c*c","-1*c*c*c","-1*a*a","1*a*b","1
//*a*c","-1*b*c"]
// 
//
// Note: 
//
// 
// expression will have length in range [1, 250]. 
// evalvars, evalints will have equal lengths in range [0, 100].
