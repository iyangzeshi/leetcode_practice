//Given an array of citations sorted in ascending order (each citation is a non-
//negative integer) of a researcher, write a function to compute the researcher's 
//h-index. 
//
// According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia: "A scientist has index h
// if h of his/her size papers have at least h citations each, and the other size ‚àí h pa
//pers have no more than h citations each." 
//
// Example: 
//
// 
//Input: citations = [0,1,3,5,6]
//Output: 3 
//Explanation: [0,1,3,5,6] means the researcher has 5 papers in total and each o
//f them had 
//             received 0, 1, 3, 5, 6 citations respectively. 
//¬†            Since the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations each 
//and the remaining 
//¬†            two with no more than 3 citations each, her h-index is 3. 
//
// Note: 
//
// If there are several possible values for h, the maximum one is taken as the h
//-index. 
//
// Follow up: 
//
// 
// This is a follow up problem to H-Index, where citations is now guaranteed to 
//be sorted in ascending order. 
// Could you solve it in logarithmic time complexity?
